# A Day in the Life of a NodeJS Developer

Failure happens. Are you ready for it? Here at Holiday Extras we've been running NodeJS in production for 5 years, it's been a critical part of our infrastructure for the last 3 years. In June 2015 we thought we had solved failure... then one day our API crumbled around us. We followed the incident with a Blameless PostMortem which forms the basis for this talk. I'm going to run through how we're using NodeJS in production, the countermeasures we had in place and a chronological run through of what happened, the metrics we care about, the mitigations and the solutions.
